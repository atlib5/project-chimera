# Project Chimera – Meta Specification

## Vision
Project Chimera is an autonomous AI influencer system designed to research trends,
generate content, and manage engagement with minimal human intervention.

The purpose of this repository is to define the specifications, rules, and infrastructure
that allow AI agents to safely and reliably build the system in the future.

## Constraints
- Specifications are the source of truth.
- No implementation code should be written without an approved specification.
- Human approval is required before publishing any generated content.
- All agent behavior must be testable and auditable.

## Non-Goals
- Building a production-ready influencer in this phase.
- Optimizing machine learning models.
- Maximizing engagement or virality at the cost of safety.

## Success Criteria
- Clear, unambiguous specifications.
- Strong separation between agent intent and implementation.
- Infrastructure that supports testing, governance, and traceability.
