# Project Chimera – Research Notes

## 1. The Trillion Dollar AI Code Stack (a16z)

What I understood:
- AI development is moving from simple apps to large systems with many layers.
- Infrastructure, testing, and deployment are becoming more important than just models.
- Companies care more about reliability and scalability than quick demos.

How this relates to Project Chimera:
- Chimera is not just an AI model, but a full system that needs structure and rules.
- Strong infrastructure is needed so AI agents do not break or hallucinate.

## 2. OpenClaw & Agent Social Networks

What I understood:
- AI agents can act independently and interact with other agents.
- Agents may form networks similar to social networks.
- Agents can share information and coordinate actions.

How agents might communicate with other agents:
- By sending structured messages (JSON or APIs).
- By publishing status or availability to a shared network.

## 3. MoltBook – Social Media for Bots

What I understood:
- MoltBook is an idea of social platforms designed for AI bots.
- Bots can create, consume, and react to content automatically.

Why this matters for autonomous influencers:
- Future influencers may be AI-first, not human-first.
- Chimera fits into a world where bots interact with bots.

## 4. Project Chimera & Agent Social Networks

How Chimera fits into an agent social network:
- Chimera can act as a content-producing agent.
- It can share trends, content, or engagement data with other agents.

Possible "social protocols" agents might need:
- Authentication (who is the agent?)
- Message format standards
- Rate limits and permissions
